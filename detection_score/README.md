# Detection Score

The detection codebase is modified from [*GLIP*](https://github.com/microsoft/GLIP). For more details, please follow the instructions in the original repo. 

### Installation and Setup

***Environment***
This repo requires Pytorch>=1.9 and torchvision. We recommand using docker to setup the environment. You can use this pre-built docker image ``docker pull pengchuanzhang/maskrcnn:ubuntu18-py3.7-cuda10.2-pytorch1.9`` or this one ``docker pull pengchuanzhang/pytorch:ubuntu20.04_torch1.9-cuda11.3-nccl2.9.9`` depending on your GPU.

Then install the following packages:
```
pip install einops shapely timm yacs tensorboardX ftfy prettytable pymongo
pip install transformers 
python setup.py build develop --user
```

***Backbone Checkpoints.*** Download the ImageNet pre-trained backbone checkpoints into the ``MODEL`` folder. 
```
mkdir MODEL
wget https://penzhanwu2bbs.blob.core.windows.net/data/GLIPv1_Open/models/swin_tiny_patch4_window7_224.pth -O swin_tiny_patch4_window7_224.pth
wget https://penzhanwu2bbs.blob.core.windows.net/data/GLIPv1_Open/models/swin_large_patch4_window12_384_22k.pth -O swin_large_patch4_window12_384_22k.pth
```


### Usage

The detection score is used to calculate the missing object rate (MOR) of the images generated by text-to-image generation models. Please put the generated images under the same directory.

```
python detection.py --method [your_method]
```
